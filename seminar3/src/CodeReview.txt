Code Review

Stage 1.Naming conventions

- rename Clasa1 to something more meaningful
- rename Calculeaza - use small caps
- rename the function arguments
- rename 'rezultat'
- rename 'valoare'
- format your code

- remove the hardcoded values aka 'magic numbers'

- validate your input values
- replace if else with switch 

Stage 2. KISS,Single Responsability ->reduce functions complexity
-remove the switch by using a generic approach for each product type
-outsource the validations
-outsource the way the fidelity discount is computed


Stage 3.Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)
-remove the dependency regarding the validation of input values
-remove the dependency on the static values - they are given by the marketing team
-remove the dependency on the way the fidelity is computed - Marketing will decide
