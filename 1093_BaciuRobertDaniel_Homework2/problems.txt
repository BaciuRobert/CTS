1.Naming conventions
-loan_value , account_Type  do not respect the general naming conventions(they use snake case instead of camel case)
-spacing rule is not respected (Account[] 	accounts)

	
2.Meaningful Names
-getter for loan needs a meaningfull name(changed to getValueOfLoan),the setValue also needs a more meaningfull name(changed to setValueOfLoan)
-the 'calculate' method name is not specific enough (change to calculateAccountsTotalFee)

3.Validations
-validate the input values
  rate cannot be < 0
  
  
-remove the magic numbers(.0125 -brokers fee),365(days in a year)


4.Excesive code
-'print' method does nothing,the variabile is not used and the print inside it doesnt display anything usefull
it should be deleted

5.Object Construction
-the Account constructor should be changed to private because it contains sensitive information


6.Fundamentals
-the class should be final since it's not used for inheritance
-minimize the accessibility of  members-make the fields private


7.Interfaces and classes
-since the lead requested for 'getMonthlyRate' to be in all classes,we should make it an interface to avoid duplicity of code
-In public classes, use accessor methods, not public fields -generate getters 


-temp is an unused variable-it should be deleted
8.Method optimization and performance problems
   -account = accounts[i] 
   -Account account 
  Those 2 lines of code are not needed and its just extra code since we can use accounts[i] directly
  
 9.Enums and Annotations
 -Use enums instead of int constants-we make an enum for STANDARD=0,BUDGET=1,PREMIUM=2,SUPER_PREMIUM=3
 
 10.	Denial of Service
 -Avoid excessive logs for unusual behavior- the print inside getLoan and getRate are extra code,they should be deleted
 
 11.Comments
 -explain your code
